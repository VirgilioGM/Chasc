# Chasc #

Control of attendance of students to the school canteen Android app.

We can differentiate two main features of Chasc. The first is to digitalize the list of students who must attend the school canteen, facilitating the process of managing the students, the dates on which they must attend the canteen and the control of their access to it.

The second is the use of NFC communication to make the attendance control process even more agile. Just by bringing a passive NFC device (bracelet, key ring, pendant, card...) to the smartphone or tablet where Chasc is running, the system automatically recognizes and marks the student who has entered.

The use of NFC communication is not essential as it is also possible to mark attendance or absence of students manually in the list. This way, Chasc becomes an ideal system for managing and controlling student attendance at the school canteen.
